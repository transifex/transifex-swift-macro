## Creating Patches

### Contributor License Agreement

Before contributing with suggested changes, you must sign our [Contributor License Agreement](https://developers.transifex.com/docs/contributing).

If you want to submit a patch that either fixes a bug or introduces a new feature, you need to have the following in mind:
* The Pull Request (PR) handles one thing, i.e. fixes a certain bug or introduces a specific new functionality, instead of combining many at once.
* Each commit should include one logical change each and should ideally be few in number per PR.
* All [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks), including the execution of the test suit, must pass.
* The Rebase workflow is followed: each branch must be rebased over `origin/master` before being allowed to get merged.

In order for a PR to be merged, at least one maintainer of this project must first review and approve it. The reviewer(s) may request changes before moving on.
